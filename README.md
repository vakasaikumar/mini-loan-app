Project Setup
To get started with the Mini Loan Application, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-loan-app.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd mini-loan-app
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
If your project requires any environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys), create a .env file in the root of your project and add the variables. For example:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
Make sure to never commit your .env file to version control (Git).

Usage
To start the application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the development server using nodemon, which will automatically reload the server on code changes.

Once the server is running, you can access the app by visiting:

plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:5000

A form to request a new loan.
A page to view your loans.
A form to add repayments.
The frontend files are located in the public/ folder.

Dependencies
Backend:
Express: Web framework for Node.js.
Cors: Middleware to enable cross-origin requests.
Nodemon: Development tool to automatically restart the server.
dotenv (optional): Load environment variables from a .env file.
Frontend:
HTML5: Markup language for building web pages.
CSS: Styling for the frontend (you can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind).
Running the Project
After you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project in two different modes:

Development Mode (with auto-reloading):
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Production Mode:
bash
Copy code
npm run start
In production mode, the server will not automatically reload.
